# Design Considerations

1. **Responsive layout**: The website layout should adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktops.
2. **Serverless architecture**: The site will not rely on a backend server. 
    Why? Simplicity of development.
    Tradeoff? Adding new projects workflow may be tedious.
3. **Neutral, dark-themed color palette**: The design will use neutral tones with a preference for dark mode to ensure visual comfort and modern aesthetics.
