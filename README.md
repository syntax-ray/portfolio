# Portfolio

This repository serves as the central hub for my personal software developer portfolio. It includes:

- The codebase for the portfolio website
- Design assets
- A project plan detailing the steps taken to build the site

### Why this is useful

1. **Self-audit**: It acts as a catalog of what Iâ€™ve built, helping me track progress and assess my skills, time investment, and growth.
2. **Visibility**: Recruiters and potential collaborators can browse my work in one place.
3. **Project index**: It links out to all my other GitHub projects, including source code and deployed applications.
4. **Contact hub**: It hosts my resume and contact information for anyone who wants to get in touch.
